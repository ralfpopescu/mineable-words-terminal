    <div>mwords (mineable_words) are NFTs that take the form of words. However, these words cannot simply be claimed - they must be mined! Any piece of text up to length 16 with letters a-z and characters @ ! . _ & ? can be found. You can either mine them yourself right here in the browser, or offer a bounty for others to find them for you. Conversely, you can earn rewards for finding other peopleâ€™s bounties. Minting costs .009 ETH, but is free if your wallet owns an mpunk <a href="https://www.mpunks.org/faq">(mpunks.org)</a>. Here are a list of commands to get you started:</div>

    <Command>mine [-n numberOfWorkers] [-s startingNonce] [[-w arrayOfWords]]</Command>
    <span>Start mining for words in the browser using your CPU. If you pass an array of words, the miner will only log when it finds those words. To change number of miner workers, pass a number between 1-8 for for the -n flag. Defaults to 4. If you pass a starting nonce, the miner will start at that number - pass r to start at a random nonce. Defaults to 0.</span>
    <span>*** example: mine -s 0x123 -w [hello,goodbye] //starts at nonce 0x123 looking for words "hello" and "goodbye"</span>
    <span>*** example: mine -s r -n 8 //starts at a random nonce, spins up 8 worker threads, and saves all words found.</span>
    <span>*** example: mine //default: starts at a 0, spins up 4 worker threads, and saves all words found.</span>
